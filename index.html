            <h2>What is Darwin</h2>
            <p>The project's purpose is to collect and analyze data from athletes for studies on their performance in physical activities. Additionally, based on the conclusions of these studies, activity plans will be proposed for these athletes that can be used to direct their training and enable them to achieve specific goals. The studies will be conducted observing consolidated scientific and ethical criteria.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of training data</h2>
            <p>Darwin aims to collect and analyze athlete data to enhance performance in endurance activities. Our insights lead to customized training plans that help athletes achieve their goals, all while upholding strict scientific and ethical standards. We chose Training Peaks for its extensive array of structured data variables and because we are also firsthand users of the application.</p>
